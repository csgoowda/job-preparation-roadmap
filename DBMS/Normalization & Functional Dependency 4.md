# Normalization & Functional Dependency (Most Asked DBMS Topic)

Today we learn **why normalization is needed**, not just definitions.

Interviewers love asking:

* What is normalization?
* Why normalization?
* Explain 1NF, 2NF, 3NF.
* What is Functional Dependency?
* What are anomalies?

---

# Before Normalization

Imagine a college stores data like this:

| StudentID | StudentName | Course1 | Course2 | Course3 |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 101       | Chethan     | DBMS    | OOP     | CN      |
| 102       | Rahul       | DBMS    | NULL    | NULL    |

Problems:

### Data Redundancy

Student details may repeat many times.

### Wasted Space

Many NULL values.

### Difficult Updates

If Chethan changes his name, we may need to update multiple places.

---

# What is Normalization?

Normalization is the process of organizing data into multiple tables to:

* Reduce redundancy
* Remove anomalies
* Improve consistency
* Improve integrity

### Interview Answer

> Normalization is the process of organizing data to minimize redundancy and dependency.

---

# Why Do We Need Normalization?

Without normalization:

### 1. Update Anomaly

Suppose:

| StudentID | StudentName | Dept |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- |
| 101       | Chethan     | ISE  |
| 102       | Chethan     | ISE  |

If Chethan's department changes,

we must update multiple rows.

If we forget one row → inconsistency.

---

### 2. Insert Anomaly

Suppose a new department exists but no students yet.

We cannot insert department information.

---

### 3. Delete Anomaly

If the last student leaves ISE,

deleting the student record may also remove department information.

---

# Functional Dependency (FD)

Before learning NFs, understand FD.

---

# What is Functional Dependency?

If one attribute determines another attribute, it is called Functional Dependency.

Notation:

```text
A → B
```

Meaning:

If we know A,
we can determine B.

---

# Example

| StudentID | Name    |
| --------- | ------- |
| 101       | Chethan |
| 102       | Rahul   |

Here:

```text
StudentID → Name
```

Because StudentID uniquely identifies Name.

---

# Another Example

| USN        | Name    | Branch |
| ---------- | ------- | ------ |
| 4SU22IS001 | Chethan | ISE    |

Then:

```text
USN → Name
USN → Branch
```

---

# Types of Functional Dependency

---

# 1. Full Functional Dependency

Attribute depends on the entire primary key.

Example:

| StudentID | CourseID | Marks |
| --------- | -------- | ----- |
| 1         | DBMS     | 90    |

Primary Key:

```text
(StudentID, CourseID)
```

Marks depend on both columns.

```text
(StudentID, CourseID) → Marks
```

This is Full Dependency.

---

# 2. Partial Dependency

Attribute depends on only part of a composite key.

Example:

| StudentID | CourseID | StudentName |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1         | DBMS     | Chethan     |

StudentName depends only on StudentID.

```text
StudentID → StudentName
```

Not on CourseID.

This is Partial Dependency.

---

# 3. Transitive Dependency

A depends on B,
B depends on C.

Then:

```text
A → C
```

indirectly.

Example:

| StudentID | DeptID | DeptName |
| --------- | ------ | -------- |
| 101       | 1      | ISE      |

Dependencies:

```text
StudentID → DeptID
DeptID → DeptName
```

Therefore:

```text
StudentID → DeptName
```

This is Transitive Dependency.

---

# First Normal Form (1NF)

Rule:

### No repeating groups

### No multi-valued attributes

---

## Not 1NF

| StudentID | Subjects    |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 101       | DBMS,OOP,CN |

Multiple values in one column.

---

## Convert to 1NF

| StudentID | Subject |
| --------- | ------- |
| 101       | DBMS    |
| 101       | OOP     |
| 101       | CN      |

Now each cell contains a single value.

---

### Easy Memory Trick

**1NF = One Cell → One Value**

---

# Second Normal Form (2NF)

Rule:

### Must be in 1NF

### Remove Partial Dependency

---

## Example

| StudentID | CourseID | StudentName |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1         | DBMS     | Chethan     |

Primary Key:

```text
(StudentID, CourseID)
```

But:

```text
StudentID → StudentName
```

Partial dependency exists.

---

## Solution

### Student Table

| StudentID | StudentName |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 1         | Chethan     |

---

### Enrollment Table

| StudentID | CourseID |
| --------- | -------- |
| 1         | DBMS     |

Now Partial Dependency removed.

---

### Easy Memory Trick

**2NF = Remove Partial Dependency**

---

# Third Normal Form (3NF)

Rule:

### Must be in 2NF

### Remove Transitive Dependency

---

## Example

| StudentID | DeptID | DeptName |
| --------- | ------ | -------- |
| 101       | 1      | ISE      |

Dependencies:

```text
StudentID → DeptID
DeptID → DeptName
```

Transitive Dependency exists.

---

## Solution

### Student Table

| StudentID | DeptID |
| --------- | ------ |
| 101       | 1      |

---

### Department Table

| DeptID | DeptName |
| ------ | -------- |
| 1      | ISE      |

Transitive dependency removed.

---

### Easy Memory Trick

**3NF = Remove Transitive Dependency**

---

# BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)

BCNF is stronger than 3NF.

Rule:

Every determinant must be a candidate key.

For interviews:

Usually understanding up to 3NF is enough.

---

# Normal Forms Summary

| Normal Form | Purpose                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1NF         | Remove repeating groups      |
| 2NF         | Remove partial dependency    |
| 3NF         | Remove transitive dependency |
| BCNF        | Stronger version of 3NF      |

---

# Complete Example

### Original Table

| StudentID | StudentName | DeptID | DeptName |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ | -------- |
| 101       | Chethan     | 1      | ISE      |

Problems:

* Repetition
* Partial dependency
* Transitive dependency

---

### After 3NF

Student Table

| StudentID | StudentName | DeptID |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 101       | Chethan     | 1      |

Department Table

| DeptID | DeptName |
| ------ | -------- |
| 1      | ISE      |

Much cleaner.
